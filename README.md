# CompressiveSensing

This project is for COMP150 Compressive Sensing Class at Tufts University.
Taught by Professor Peter Sang Chin.

The directory contains many testing algorithm programs. But the final submission for class paper is in folder /submission

The paper, "A Comparison of Basis Pursuit, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and Subspace Matching Pursuit and their Performance Differences", is essentially a literature review and performance modeling of some Compressive Sensing Algorithms with major contribution from website http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/
